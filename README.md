# Clone-BnB

Welcome to **Clone-BnB**, an Airbnb clone project built with the aim to learn TypeScript and Next.js! This project is a fun, casual, and light-hearted take on creating an Airbnb-like application. üè°‚ú®

You can check out the live demo of Clone-BnB here: [https://clone-bnb-beta.vercel.app/](https://clone-bnb-beta.vercel.app/)


## Tech Stack & Libraries

Clone-BnB leverages a powerful combination of cutting-edge technologies and libraries to create a seamless and engaging user experience. The core components of the tech stack include:

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript serves as the foundation of the project, offering type safety and improved code readability.
- **Next.js 13**: The application takes advantage of the latest Next.js release, which delivers automatic static optimization, server-side rendering, and API routes for a robust development experience.
- **Prisma**: I used Prisma as the ORM to simplify database management, making data access and manipulation more efficient and convenient.
- **TailwindCSS**: TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework, streamlines the process of styling UI components, allowing for rapid development without the need for custom CSS classes.
- **Zustand**: Zustand, a lightweight state management library, enables easy management and sharing of state across components.

In addition to these core technologies, you'll find a range of other libraries and frameworks in the `package.json` file. Feel free to explore the repository for a comprehensive overview!
